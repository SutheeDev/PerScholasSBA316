# Per Scholas SBA316

Welcome to SBA316, where I developed [SnailMail](https://perscholas-sba316.netlify.app/), a fun and engaging typing speed test game designed to challenge your typing skills with email-like text. Featuring a clean layout and a touch of deadpan humor, SnailMail brings an entertaining twist to traditional typing tests.
